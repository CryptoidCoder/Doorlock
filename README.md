TODO:
- create alias to the 'emergencyclose.py' and 'emergencyopen.py' scripts so you can type straight into the terminal 'lock' and 'unlock'
- make face detection open the door
- make the button on the back of the door unlock the door.
- make the reset codes work.
- make it all work through a phone
